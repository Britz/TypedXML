# TypedJSON

Typed XML parsing and serializing that preserves type information. Parse XML into actual class instances. Recommended (but not required)
to be used with reflect-metadata (global installation): https://github.com/rbuckton/ReflectDecorators. 

*v0.0.1-apha.1*

Cloned from TypedJSON (v0.2.0 - https://github.com/JohnWhiteTB/TypedJSON).
Work in progress ...

## Future Plans

 - Generate annotations (decorators) to parse and serialize XML, similar to TypedJSON.
 - Fork/include cxml (https://github.com/charto/cxml), which aims be the most advanced schema-aware streaming XML parser for JavaScript and TypeScript, to support TypedXML annotations.
 - Fork/include cxsd (https://github.com/charto/cxsd), to generate annotated typescript classes from XSD.
